# S33 Closure Session Canon

This is the repo-tracked mirror of the deployment-site source artifact at:

`/Users/4jp/Workspace/organvm-i-theoria/conversation-corpus-site/2026-03-24-conversation-corpus-engine-s33-closure-session-canon.md`

It exists to satisfy the persistence rule that important session memory must survive both locally and remotely. The deployment-site copy is the ingest-ready markdown source for `ai-exports-markdown-memory`; this repo copy is the Git-tracked soul that survives host loss.

## Verified Outcomes

S33 shipped 12 CCE commits from `8286af7` through `c41fc89`: readiness fallback repair, search pre-filter fix, ChatGPT adapter capability cherry-pick, `pipx` installability, DeepSeek + Mistral providers, dashboard command, triage automation, CLAUDE.md refresh, 35 tests plus one bug fix, roadmap persistence, and `seed.yaml` capability-edge updates.

The verified close state was:

- `main` clean and up to date
- `86` tests passing
- `GH#1` through `GH#9` closed
- `GH#9` carrying an explicit resolution comment
- review queue reduced from `3,854` to `1,649`

## Cross-Repo Propagation

S33 also propagated into:

- `organvm-corpvs-testamentvm` via registry refresh, IRF updates, concordance expansion, and `MILESTONE-2026-003`
- `praxis-perpetua` via new governance-mechanism evidence on `INQ-2026-002`

## Remaining Named Work

The durable post-S33 backlog is:

- `IRF-CCE-014`: record S33 testament events through actual cascade tooling
- `IRF-CCE-015`: ratify `OM-MEM-001` and regenerate or repair omega state
- `IRF-CCE-016`: bring Claude export adapter to ChatGPT parity
- `IRF-CCE-017`: test the remaining 10 untested modules
- `IRF-CCE-018`: add semantic-similarity triage for the remaining queue

## Operational Rule

S33 established a closure rule worth preserving in-repo:

1. Scope GitHub checks to the intended repository explicitly.
2. Treat every N/A as a vacuum until it is resolved or logged.
3. Do not declare closure from summary prose; read the actual command output and files on disk.
